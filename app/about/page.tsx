        <Paragraph>
          The Comic DB was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate comic book enthusiasts who wanted to create a
          comprehensive database of comics from around the world. What started as a small project among friends has
          grown into one of the most extensive comic book databases on the web.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Our journey began when we realized how difficult it was to track our own comic collections and discover new
          titles across different publishers and genres. We wanted to build something that would serve both casual
          readers and dedicated collectors alike.
